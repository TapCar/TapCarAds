## Introduction
This is the second project for the Web Development Part Time started in January 2019. Developed by Roberto Pernicode and Pedro Aviles.

The current MVP offers the following features:
* Login/Signup through email
* Full CRUD for advertisement zones
* Creation, listing and updating of advertisement campaigns
